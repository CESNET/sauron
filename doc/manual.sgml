    <title>Introduction</>
    <para>
      Sauron is a scalable system for management of DNS and DHCP services.
      Sauron can dynamically generate complete DNS and DHCP configurations
      from a central SQL-database. Automatic generation of DNS 
      <quote>reverse</> zones (with support for smaller than C-class
      reverse delegations) is supported. Sauron comes with web interface
      and command-line interface. The web interface comes 
      with user/group based access controls for distributed management.
    </para>

    <section>
      <title>History of Sauron</>
      <para>
        Sauron was originally designed and written by Timo Kokkonen 
        at the Computing Center of University of Jyvaskyla. 
        In 1999, when work on Sauron was started, it was meant to provide 
        a simple web based interface for letting multiple users 
        simultaneously manage DNS zone files, but it has since
        grown into a full featured DNS & DHCP management software.
      </para>
      <para>
        Sauron is still under development, but it has been in production 
        use since early 2001, managing the campus area network (CAN) with 
        over 10,000 computers at University of Jyvaskyla, Finland.
      </para>
      <para>
        In January 2003, Sauron was publicly released under the GNU
        General Public License (<acronym>GPL</>).
      </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>System Overview</>
      <para>
        Sauron is built around sauron <quote>back-end</> that is used by the
        command-line and web interfaces to access the data stored in a
        SQL-database (see <xref linkend="overview-fig">). 
        Sauron is able to dynamically generate
        complete DNS (ISC BIND) and DHCP (ISC DHCP) configurations based
        on the data stored in the SQL-databse. Sauron is currently written
        almost completely in Perl using only standard perl modules and
        couple of additional modules from CPAN. Web interface is standalone
        CGI script and should work with almost any www server that supports
        CGI.
      </para>
      <para>
        Database is organized as follows; 
        a number of servers may be defined where each server may contain
        several zones. At server level there may be "global" definitions 
        for DNS &  DHCP settings and a Layer-2 network map (VLAN map) 
        which is used generating necessary topology information for dhcpd. 
        Each server can have multiple (DNS) zones defined. Hosts belong to 
        a zone and may contain additional information (such as asset IDs) 
        in addition to DNS/DHCP information.

      <title>Installing Sauron</>
      <para>
        Sauron is currently available as a source <quote>tarball</> as well
        as a RPM package (RPM package is made for RedHat Linux systems).
        Decide which version you want to use to install Sauron from and
        and proceed to either <xref linkend="install-tgz"> or 
        <xref linkend="install-rpm">.
      </para>

      <section id="install-tgz">
        <title>Installing from the sources</title>
        <para>
        First step, when installing from the source archive
        is to unpack the tar file into a directory and change
        current directory to that directory. This can be
        done as follows:
        <screen>
        gunzip -c sauron-0.5.0.tar.gz | tar xvf -
        cd sauron-0.5.0
        </screen>
        </para>
        
        <para>
        Next step is to install Sauron from the sources. By default
        sauron program files will be installed under 
        <filename class=directory>/usr/local/sauron</>,
        and configuration files under 
        <filename class=directory>/usr/local/etc/sauron</>. If you
        want to install sauron under some other directories you need
        to specify 
        <parameter class=command>--prefix</> and
        <parameter class=command>--sysconfdir</> arguments when invoking 
        configure script. To install Sauron under default directories
        issue following commands:
        <screen>
        ./configure
        make
        make docs
        make install
        </screen>
        </para>

      </section>

      <section id="install-rpm">
        <title>Installing from the RPM</>
       <para>
       To install (or update) Sauron from RPM package you can simply
       istall the package as follows:
       <screen>
       rpm -Uvh sauron-0.5.0-1.noarch.rpm
       </screen>
       </para>
      </section>

    <section>
      <title>Sauron Configuration</>
      <para>
      Sauron configuration settings are stored in <filename>config</>
      file, which is usually located in
      <filename class=directory>/usr/local/etc/sauron/</>
      or in <filename class=directory>/etc/sauron/</> (if Sauron
      is installed from RPM). This configuration file is parsed
      actually as a Perl code, so it is possible to set the configuration
      variables conditionally if desired.
      </para>
      <para>
      Configuration file contains common configuration settings for
      all Sauron components (except browser.cgi which uses it's own
      configuration file <filename>config-browser</>). Here we cover
      only the basic settings that you need to set before using Sauron.
      For more advanced settings, see the configuration file where 
      all the advanced configuration options are documented.

        there is <application>createtables</> utility, that is included
        with Sauron. To initialize the database, simply run following command
        in Sauron program directory:
        <screen>
        ./createtables
        </screen>
        This command will create all the necessary tables needed by Sauron.
        You can check that everything worked by issuing the following command:
        <screen>
        ./status
        </screen>
        This should produce output similar to following showing that the
        database connection works:
        <screen>
Sauron v0.5.0 status

Database connection:   OK
Database version:      1.0
CGI interface:         Enabled

No servers found in database!

      <title>Initializing Global Tables</>
      <para>
        Sauron has several global tables that contain data that is used
        by all servers stored in a Sauron database. These tables contain
        a table (<filename>ether_info</>) that contains mappings of
        <acronym>OUI</>'s to Manufacturers which is used to display
        the manufacturers of <acronym>NICs</> based on the
        <hardware>Ethernet</> <acronym>MAC</> address.
        There is also a table (<filename>root_servers</>) that contains
        global (default) root server information, and optionally also
        server specific root server information.
      </para>
 
      <para>
        To populate OUI (<filename>ether_info</>) table with the
        included files, issue following commands in the Sauron top-level
        directory:
        <screen>
        ./import-ethers contrib/Ethernet.txt
        ./import-ethers --force contrib/additional-ether-codes.txt
        </screen>
        You may also want to download <acronym>IEEE</>'s 
        up to date public list of OUIs from 
        <ulink url="http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/index.shtml">
          <citetitle>IEEE's web site</></ulink>, and install it as follows:
        <screen>
        ./import-ethers oui.txt
        </screen>
      </para>
 
      <para>
        You should also add default root servers into <filename>root_servers</>
        table. This can be done as follows:
        <screen>
        ./import-roots default contrib/named.root
        </screen>
        NOTE! remember to check for newer version of this file at
        <ulink url="ftp://ftp.rs.internic.net/domain/">
          <citetitle>ftp.rs.internic.net</>
        </ulink>.

    <section>
      <title>WWW Server Configuration</>
      <para>
        To be able to use Sauron's web interface you need to make
        <filename>sauron.cgi</> and <filename>browser.cgi</>
        (if you wan't to use the Sauron DNS browser) available through
        your www server. To do this you typically would either make symbolic
        links to these files or copy these files in your 
        <filename class=directory>cgi-bin</> directory. Note, if you're
        installing from the <acronym>RPM</> package, these symbolic links
        are created automatically, so you only need to check that your 
        web server configuration allow symlinks in your cgi-bin directory.

      </para> 
      <para>
          You should use your web server configuration and/or firewall
          to limit access to <filename>sauron.cgi</> and 
          <filename>browser.cgi</> cgi scripts only from the machines
          you need to access Sauron from.
      </para>

      <para>
         Sauron web interface uses several icons and images that are
         by default installed under the top-level sauron directory.
         You need to make these available through your web server
         via <filename class=directory>/sauron/icons/</> directory
         (unless you're installing from the RPM which does this automatically
         for you).
         To do this you can create that directory under your
         www server root and then either make symbolic links or copy
         all the image files from 
         <filename class=directory>&lt;sauron top-level directory&gt;/icons/</>
         into this directory.

    <title>Getting Started</>
    <para>
      This chapter is intended as a brief overview of how to build a simple
      DNS & DHCP server configuraton using Sauron. For those in hurry, 
      there is also small demonstration database that can be used to test 
      Sauron quickly (see <xref linkend="demo-db-sec">).
    </para>

    <section>
    <title>Creating User Account</title>
    <para>
      First step before using Sauron is to create administrator account(s).
      Administrator accounts are normal user accounts that have superuser
      flag enabled. For adding accounts there is command-line utility
      <application>adduser</> that can be used to add user accounts either
      interactive or batch mode. To add administrator (superuser) account
      interactively, invoke <application>adduser</> with option
      <option>--superuser</>:
      <screen>
        ./adduser --superuser
      </screen>
      Here is sample output from <application>adduser</> program:
      <screen>
Enter username: admin
Enter group name (empty for none): 
Enter user description (full name): Administrator
Enter user email address: hostmaster@middle.earth
Enter optional user info: 
Enter account expiration date (dd-mm-yyyy, +&lt;n&gt;d, +&lt;n&gt;y) [none]: 
Enter password [JD!JqRGg]: 
           Username: admin
              Group: &lt;none&gt;
           Longname: Administrator
              email: hostmaster@middle.earth
            comment: 
         expiration: &lt;none&gt;
          superuser: true
Add this user [y/n]?y
User admin added succesfully.
      </screen>
      Normal users accounts can be added interactively by starting 
      <application>adduser</> without any arguments. Difference between
      superuser accounts and normal user accounts is that normal accounts
      need to be granted permission to acces/modify desired 
      servers/zones/hosts. See <xref linkend="account-management"> for
      more infomation about maning user accounts and priviliges.

    <title>Creating New Server</title>
    <para>
      Sauron can manage multiple servers, where each <quote>server</>
      is contains its own DNS & DHCP server configuration information.
      This allows single Sauron system to manage multiple DNS & DHCP
      servers. Normally each servers are completely separate from each
      other, but it is possible to generate <quote>slave</> servers that
      use another server as a master server, and inherit it's all master
      zones (as slave zones), and optionally slave server can also
      inherit master server's access controls (for DNS server).
    </para>
    <para>
      There are two ways to create a new server in Sauron. One is to
      import existing DNS & DHCP configuration into Sauron, for easier
      migration into use of Sauron. Another way is to start from
      <quote>scratch</> and create new server and zones interactively
      using Sauron's web interface. Following sections show example
      how to do this both ways (there is also section showing how to
      use the included demo database to take a quick look how sauron
      works; <xref linkend="demo-db-sec">).
    </para>
      <section> 
      <title>Using Web Interface</>
      <para>
        First, login using the web interface as an administrator into Sauron.
        You should now be in <quote>Select server</> dialog, 
        with empty list of servers to choose from. Now select <quote>Add</>
        to add a new server. 

        &form-new-server;
      </para>

      <para>
        Next step is to define global DHCP server settings, by choosing
        <guimenuitem>Edit</> from <guimenu>Servers</> menu. Now you
        can add desired DHCP settings in the 
        <guimenuitem>Global DHCP Settings</> field, one setting per line
        without the semicolon (;) at the end of line. Here's some
        typical global DHCP settings:
        <screen>
        authoritative
        allow bootp
        use-host-decl-names on
        default-lease-time 7200
        max-lease-time 38400
        option domain-name-servers ns1.middle.earth,ns2.middle.earth
        option ntp-servers ntp1.middle.earth,ntp2.middle.earth
        </screen>
      </para>

      <para>
        Next step is to add the deault zones (localhost and reverse
        zones for 0.0.0.0/8, 127.0.0.0/8, and 255.0.0.0/8) into the server.
        This can be done from <guimenu>Zones</> menu using
        <guimenuitem>Add Default Zones</>, which should produce following
        output:
        <screen>
Adding zone: localhost...OK (id=1)
Adding zone: 127.in-addr.arpa...OK (id=2)
Adding zone: 0.in-addr.arpa...OK (id=3)
Adding zone: 255.in-addr.arpa...OK (id=4)
        </screen>
      </para>

      <para>
        Now its time to add your zone(s) into the server. This can be
        done from <guimenu>Zones</> using the <guimenuitem>Add</> command.

        &form-new-zone;

        After creating a zone, edit the zone by selecting <guimenuitem>Edit</>
        from <guimenu>Zones</> menu, and add Name server (<acronym>NS</>) 
        entries and other needed entries for the zone.

        &form-edit-zone;
      </para>
