general:
	- test whether changing TEXT fiels in hosts table to appropriate
	  CHAR(n) fields would improve speed...
	- add 'install' to Makefile.in; directory generation, symlink
	  generation (moduser->modgroup)
        - write (command-line :) utility for easily generating large
	  number of host entries, and to import interactively hosts
	  from text files in standard zonefile format...

import:
	- remove unneccessary (?) quoting (\"...) from dhcp (and other) records
	- add allow-query/allow-transfer/also-notify support for zones
	- real parser for both imports
        - rewrite parse-host-rows in perl (feasible?)


sauron:
	- more sanity checks

sauron.cgi:
	- fix timeout problem with huge zone/server deletes...(faster server :)
