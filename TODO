general:
        - write (command-line :) utility for easily generating large
	  number of host entries, and to import interactively hosts
	  from text files in standard zonefile format...
	- IPv6 support
        - add database format version check in db_connect{,2}
	- change database routines to be less PostgreSQL dependant
	- add DNSSEC (tsig) support
	- add ACL (BIND) support
	- allow '*' in hostnames
	- method for cleaning up ever-growing history/lastlog tables
	- allow long usernames
	- add Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) support
	- user_rights: hostmasks should be either global, by server, or
	  by zone....
	- user_rights: should be possible to refer only a zone within
	  a server (or all zones within server)
	- allow use of '*' wildcard in domain name


import:
	- real parser for both imports
	- support for parsing letter notation dates in zone files

sauron:
	- more sanity checks
	- printcap generation
        - changes to server configuration should cause status
          command to list pending "changes" for that server
	- tinydns support (?)


sauron.cgi:
	- fix timeout problem with huge zone/server deletes...(faster server :)
	- add quick search like in browser.cgi
	- remove confirm from logout (?)
	- templates for adding hosts
	- allow user to list her previous sessions (similar to
          "last" command-line command)
        - more detailed logging (especially  host add/edit/delete)
	- allow MX template selection fro AREC aliases
	- allow creation of host with IP that is already reserved
	  (now one has to create host with temp ip and then edit ip)
	- mechanism to select multiple hosts and edit/move/delete them..

browser.cgi:
	- optional user authentication support




next database format (1.2):
	- hosts: change ether_key to server wide (instead of just zone)
	- IPv6 stuff
