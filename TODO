general:
	- test whether changing TEXT fiels in hosts table to appropriate
	  CHAR(n) fields would improve speed...
        - write (command-line :) utility for easily generating large
	  number of host entries, and to import interactively hosts
	  from text files in standard zonefile format...
	- IPv6 support
	- fix "wrong year" bug in update-dhcp-info
	- add DHCP v3 support to update-dhcp-info
	- fix addgroup / implement delgroup

import:
	- fix import(s) to work with new table layout
	- remove unneccessary (?) quoting (\"...) from dhcp (and other) records
	- add allow-query/allow-transfer/also-notify support for zones
	- real parser for both imports
        - rewrite parse-host-rows in perl (feasible?)


sauron:
	- more sanity checks

sauron.cgi:
	- fix timeout problem with huge zone/server deletes...(faster server :)
